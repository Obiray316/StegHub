WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (LAMP STACK) IN AWS

Introduction:

A “LAMP” stack is a group of open source software that is typically installed together in order to enable a server to host dynamic websites and web apps written in PHP. This term is an acronym which represents the Linux operating system with the Apache web server. The site data is stored in a MySQL database, and dynamic content is processed by PHP. In order to complete this project, we need an AWS account and a server with Ubuntu OS Server.

STEP ONE: Create and EC2 instance on AWS. Using the AWS Management Console, we can set up an ubuntu server in our most preferred region and connect to the EC2 instance using SSH cryptographic key known as PEM(Privacy Enhanced Mail) file.
